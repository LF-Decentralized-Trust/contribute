## What Is a TSC Team

A Technical Steering Committee (TSC) is a group of people responsible for the technical oversight and strategic technical direction of an open source project hosted under the LFDT umbrella. The responsibilities of the team include decision-making about technical matters that span the project, the community that contributes to it and its end users.

In general:

- The TSC is responsible for all technical oversight of the open source project. 
- TSC meetings must be open to the public and should be recorded for future reference. 
- TSC members drive the main objectives of a project as well as decision making on features development and scope. 
- While in some cases the TSC can govern the progression of roles of the project contributors, in most cases, this is voted by the project Maintainers: 
  - Contributor roles are:
    - Contributors: anyone submitting code, documentation, reviews, issues or discussions.
    - Committers: contributors granted write access to one or more repos in the organization.
    - Maintainers: committers who have earned voting rights on governance concerns and sub-project oversight.
